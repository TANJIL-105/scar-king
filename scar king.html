            <p style="font-size: x-large;">Skar King[1] (スカーキング Sukā Kingu) or simply known as Skar, is the main antagonist of the 2024 sci-fi action crossover film, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the fifth installment of the MonsterVerse franchise.

                He was a sadistic and tyrannical orangutan/chimpanzee-like Titan who ruled over a clan of other simian-like Titans with an iron fist and was personally responsible for the deaths of countless other Titans.
                
                No longer satisfied with simply having dominion over the Hollow Earth, he used the ice-based Titan Shimo, who he controls with a crystal that causes her pain, to unleash destruction upon the Surface World by triggering a new ice age.
                   
                Not much is known about the origins of Skar King, but in the ancient past, he attempted to achieve world domination in the surface world. At an unknown point in time, he took control of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, against her will, by using a crystal on the tail of a Warbat's spinal column as a whip, and forced Shimo to start the last Ice Age. He also waged war on Godzilla, but the Titan managed to defeat him before imprisoning Skar King and the remaining members of his tribe deep in the Hollow Earth for millennia.
